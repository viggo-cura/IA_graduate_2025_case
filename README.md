# I&A Graduate 2025 - case instructions

As a consultant within data, you'll often deep dive into client datasets and try to find valuable insights for them. To practise this, you are here tasked with analyzing customer data from a subscription-based business. The client has provided two datasets: **transactions.csv** and **demographics.csv**. Your goal is to evaluate and analyze this data to extract insights that can drive business decisions aimed at improving customer retention and increasing revenue.

## Data description
The transactions.csv file contains transactions the customers have made during a certain time period. The subscription fees are monthly, and always billed on the first of the month. The dataset only contains transactional data related to the customers starting, changing or ending a subscription. The transaction types are:
- Initial - the customer starts their first subscription
- Upgrade - the customer goes to a higher subscription plan
- Reduction - the customer goes to a lower subscription plan
- Churn - the customer cancels, or fails to renew, their subscription

The demographics.csv file contains data about the subscribing customers. They are uniquely identified by their customer ID.

While data used in school often is in good shape, this is unfortunately not always the case in the industry, so some data cleaning might be needed before conducting the analysis. 

## Task
Combine the datasets into a single file without renaming any of the original columns. Your analysis should focus on customer behavior and its impact on revenue. The code must be written in Python, with all steps well-documented. Any external open source packages are allowed, but need to be clearly listed. Once completed, submit both the code and the combined dataset. The dataset must be submitted as a **.csv** file, and the code must be sent as a **.py** or **.ipynb** file. **Don’t spend more than 2-3 hours on your analysis**.

## Approach

Solve the task using data science, ML or AI techniques. It is up to you to solve it with the resources you are most proficient in! There is no wrong or right answer, put your focus on what you find the most important in the data and for the client.

## Presentation
Finally, prepare a visual presentation of your findings aimed at a non-technical CEO, emphasizing actionable insights. The presentation should also include motivations of your choice of method.

[This link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13jqFbg-b5FUtqBzVEn_LgWrOUzi_nCdVunjXh5DL0l4/edit?usp=sharing) contains a Google slides template, with some different options for slide formats, that you should make a copy of and then use for visuals in your presentation. The presentation does not need to use any fancy effects or visuals, just a clear and clean format. Highlight your findings and your approach. The presentation should be 10-15 minutes long, and then there will be 15-20 minutes for questions and general discussion afterwards. 

## Hand in
The final hand-in should consist of:
- Your Google slides presentation file (name it *‘firstname_lastname_presentation.pptx’*)
- The final, processed dataset, as a single file in a .csv format (name it *‘firstname_lastname_dataset.csv’*)
- Your code notebook (name it *‘firstname_lastname_code.py’* or *‘firstname_lastname_code.ipynb’*)

Deadline for hand-in: 23:59 the Xth of November


### *Good luck and enjoy! :)*
